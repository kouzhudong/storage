void AppendingOneFileToAnotherFile()
/*
Appending One File to Another File
2018/05/31

The code example in this topic shows you how to open and close files, read and write to files, and lock and unlock files.

In the example, the application appends one file to the end of another file.
First, the application opens the file being appended with permissions that allow only the application to write to it.
However, during the append process other processes can open the file with read-only permission,
which provides a snapshot view of the file being appended.
Then, the file is locked during the actual append process to ensure the integrity of the data being written to the file.

This example does not use transactions. If you were using transacted operations, you would only be able have read-only access.
In this case, you would only see the appended data after the transaction commit operation completed.

The example also shows that the application opens two files by using CreateFile:

One.txt is opened for reading.
Two.txt is opened for writing and shared reading.
Then the application uses ReadFile and WriteFile to append the contents of One.txt to the end of Two.txt by reading and writing the 4 KB blocks.
However, before writing to the second file,
the application uses SetFilePointer to set the pointer of the second file to the end of that file,
and uses LockFile to lock the area to be written.
This prevents another thread or process with a duplicate handle from accessing the area while the write operation is in progress.
When each write operation is complete, UnlockFile is used to unlock the locked area.

/*
Creating and Using a Temporary File
2018/05/31

Applications can obtain unique file and path names for temporary files by using the GetTempFileName and GetTempPath functions.
The GetTempFileName function generates a unique file name,
and the GetTempPath function retrieves the path to a directory where temporary files should be created.

The following procedure describes how an application creates a temporary file for data manipulation purposes.

To create and use a temporary file

The application opens the user-provided source text file by using CreateFile.
The application retrieves a temporary file path and file name by using the GetTempPath and GetTempFileName functions,
and then uses CreateFile to create the temporary file.
The application reads blocks of text data into a buffer,
converts the buffer contents to uppercase using the CharUpperBuffA function,
and writes the converted buffer to the temporary file.
When all of the source file is written to the temporary file, the application closes both files,
and renames the temporary file to "allcaps.txt" by using the MoveFileEx function.
Each of the previous steps is checked for success before moving to the next step, and a failure description is displayed if an error occurs.
The application will terminate immediately after displaying the error message.

Note that text file manipulation was chosen for ease of demonstration only and can be replaced with any desired data manipulation procedure required.
The data file can be of any data type, not only text.

The GetTempPath function retrieves a fully qualified path string from an environment variable but does not check in advance for the existence of the path or adequate access rights to that path, which is the responsibility of the application developer.
For more information, see GetTempPath.
In the following example, an error is regarded as a terminal condition and the application exits after sending a descriptive message to standard output.
However, many other options exist, such as prompting the user for a temporary directory or simply attempting to use the current directory.

 ±¸×¢
The GetTempFileName function does not require that the GetTempPath function be used.

The following C++ example shows how to create a temporary file for data manipulation purposes.

//
//  This application opens a file specified by the user and uses
//  a temporary file to convert the file to upper case letters.
//  Note that the given source file is assumed to be an ASCII text file
//  and the new file created is overwritten each time the application is
//  run.

Retrieving and Changing File Attributes
2018/05/31

An application can retrieve the file attributes by using the GetFileAttributes or GetFileAttributesEx function.
The CreateFile and SetFileAttributes functions can set many of the attributes. However, applications cannot set all attributes.

The code example in this topic uses the CopyFile function to copy all text files (.txt) in the current directory to a new directory of read-only files.
Files in the new directory are changed to read only, if necessary.

The application creates the directory specified as a parameter by using the CreateDirectory function.
The directory must not exist already.

The application searches the current directory for all text files by using the FindFirstFile and FindNextFile functions.
Each text file is copied to the \TextRO directory. After a file is copied, the GetFileAttributes function determines whether or not a file is read only.
If the file is not read only, the application changes directories to \TextRO and converts the copied file to read only by using the SetFileAttributes function.

After all text files in the current directory are copied, the application closes the search handle by using the FindClose function.

/*
Testing for the End of a File
2018/05/31

The ReadFile function checks for the end-of-file condition (EOF) differently for synchronous and asynchronous read operations.
When a synchronous read operation gets to the end of a file,
ReadFile returns TRUE and sets the variable pointed to by the lpNumberOfBytesRead parameter to zero.
An asynchronous read operation can encounter the end of a file during the initiating call to ReadFile or during subsequent asynchronous operations if the file pointer is programmatically advanced beyond the end of the file.

The following C++ example shows how to test for the end of a file during a synchronous read operation.

  // Attempt a synchronous read operation.
  bResult = ReadFile(hFile, &inBuffer, nBytesToRead, &nBytesRead, NULL);

  // Check for eof.
  if (bResult &&  nBytesRead == 0)
   {
    // at the end of the file
   }

The test for end-of-file during an asynchronous read operation is slightly more involved than for a similar synchronous read operation.
The end-of-file indicator for asynchronous read operations is when GetOverlappedResult returns FALSE and GetLastError returns ERROR_HANDLE_EOF.

The following C++ example shows how to test for the end of file during an asynchronous read operation.

Maximum Path Length Limitation
In the Windows API (with some exceptions discussed in the following paragraphs), the maximum length for a path is MAX_PATH, 
which is defined as 260 characters.
A local path is structured in the following order: drive letter, colon, backslash, name components separated by backslashes, 
and a terminating null character.
For example, the maximum path on drive D is "D:\some 256-character path string<NUL>" where "<NUL>" represents the invisible terminating null character for the current system codepage.
(The characters < > are used here for visual clarity and cannot be part of a valid path string.)

Note  File I/O functions in the Windows API convert "/" to "\" as part of converting the name to an NT-style name, 
except when using the "\\?\" prefix as detailed in the following sections.
The Windows API has many functions that also have Unicode versions to permit an extended-length path for a maximum total path length of 32,767 characters.
This type of path is composed of components separated by backslashes, 
each up to the value returned in the lpMaximumComponentLength parameter of the GetVolumeInformation function (this value is commonly 255 characters).
To specify an extended-length path, use the "\\?\" prefix. For example, "\\?\D:\very long path".

Note  The maximum path of 32,767 characters is approximate, 
because the "\\?\" prefix may be expanded to a longer string by the system at run time, 
and this expansion applies to the total length.
The "\\?\" prefix can also be used with paths constructed according to the universal naming convention (UNC).
To specify such a path using UNC, use the "\\?\UNC\" prefix. 
For example, "\\?\UNC\server\share", where "server" is the name of the computer and "share" is the name of the shared folder.
These prefixes are not used as part of the path itself. 
They indicate that the path should be passed to the system with minimal modification,
which means that you cannot use forward slashes to represent path separators, 
or a period to represent the current directory, or double dots to represent the parent directory.
Because you cannot use the "\\?\" prefix with a relative path, 
relative paths are always limited to a total of MAX_PATH characters.

There is no need to perform any Unicode normalization on path and file name strings for use by the Windows file I/O API functions because the file system treats path and file names as an opaque sequence of WCHARs.
Any normalization that your application requires should be performed with this in mind, external of any calls to related Windows file I/O API functions.

When using an API to create a directory, the specified path cannot be so long that you cannot append an 8.3 file name (that is, the directory name cannot exceed MAX_PATH minus 12).

The shell and the file system have different requirements. 
It is possible to create a path with the Windows API that the shell user interface is not able to interpret properly.
